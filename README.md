Tied-Up Tic-Tac-Toe by Isabella Cai
===========
Tired of how the first player who moves in Tic-Tac-Toe always has double the chances of winning? 
Tired of how the second player can only either lose or tie if the first player 
Tired of not having a challenging opponent who always moves pieces to the perfect position?

I bring to you Tied-Up Tic-Tac-Toe, a human vs. AI tic-tac-toe game written in Python that 
guarantees the human player either a tie or a loss, but only a tie at best. (You would have 
to tweak the code around a bit to win the game).
